# AtliQ Mart Supply Chain Analytics Project

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India.  
It is currently operational in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara.  
They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues.  
It is speculated that some essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, resulting in poor customer service.  
Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and has requested the supply chain analytics team to track the **'On-time'** and **'In-Full'** delivery service levels for all customers on a daily basis, so they can respond swiftly to these issues.

The Supply Chain team decided to use a standard approach to measure the service levels by tracking:
- **On-time delivery (OT) %**
- **In-full delivery (IF) %**
- **On-Time In-Full (OTIF) %**

They will measure these metrics daily against the target service level set for each customer.
